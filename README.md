# Summary

This application provides a visualization of different health risk factors and age as a factor.  It is an interactive visualization using D3 for display of elements of the plots and for event handling:

* Clicking on an axis label changes that axis to represent that factor: Age vs. % Smokers (x-axis) and % Obesity vs. % Poverty (y-axis).
* Hovering over a state displays in a tool tip box the relevant data for the displayed axes for that specific state.  Clicking the state will keep that tool tip persistent on the screen until the mouse moves over a different state.
